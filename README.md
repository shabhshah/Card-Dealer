# Card-Dealer
A group of card dealing and analyzing programs I wrote for my programming class.

*blackjack.py* is a work in progress of a Black Jack game.

*cardanalyzer.py* is not complete yet.

*carddealer.py* asks for the number of hands and cards per hand a user would like from a standard deck of cards. The resulting hands are printed.

*carddealer2.py* asks for the number of hands and cards per hand a user would like from a standard deck. It also asks for the number of times the program should deal these hands and the name of the textfile that the program will output results to. The resulting hands are added to a textfile.
